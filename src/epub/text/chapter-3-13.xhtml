				<p epub:type="title">The Third Trial Fails</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>So the second trial in the prison was over. Over, and no definite result. The character of it I have described to you. It was baser in one particular than the previous one; for this time the charges had not been communicated to Joan, therefore she had been obliged to fight in the dark. There was no opportunity to do any thinking beforehand; there was no foreseeing what traps might be set, and no way to prepare for them. Truly it was a shabby advantage to take of a girl situated as this one was. One day, during the course of it, an able lawyer of Normandy, Maître Lohier, happened to be in Rouen, and I will give you his opinion of that trial, so that you may see that I have been honest with you, and that my partisanship has not made me deceive you as to its unfair and illegal character. Cauchon showed Lohier the procès and asked his opinion about the trial. Now this was the opinion which he gave to Cauchon. He said that the whole thing was null and void; for these reasons: 1, because the trial was secret, and full freedom of speech and action on the part of those present not possible; 2, because the trial touched the honor of the King of France, yet he was not summoned to defend himself, nor anyone appointed to represent him; 3, because the charges against the prisoner were not communicated to her; 4, because the accused, although young and simple, had been forced to defend her cause without help of counsel, notwithstanding she had so much at stake.</p>
			<p>Did that please Bishop Cauchon? It did not. He burst out upon Lohier with the most savage cursings, and swore he would have him drowned. Lohier escaped from Rouen and got out of France with all speed, and so saved his life.</p>
			<p>Well, as I have said, the second trial was over, without definite result. But Cauchon did not give up. He could trump up another. And still another and another, if necessary. He had the half-promise of an enormous prize⁠—the Archbishopric of Rouen⁠—if he should succeed in burning the body and damning to hell the soul of this young girl who had never done him any harm; and such a prize as that, to a man like the Bishop of Beauvais, was worth the burning and damning of fifty harmless girls, let alone one.</p>
			<p>So he set to work again straight off next day; and with high confidence, too, intimating with brutal cheerfulness that he should succeed this time. It took him and the other scavengers nine days to dig matter enough out of Joan’s testimony and their own inventions to build up the new mass of charges. And it was a formidable mass indeed, for it numbered sixty-six articles.</p>
			<p>This huge document was carried to the castle the next day, March 27th; and there, before a dozen carefully selected judges, the new trial was begun.</p>
			<p>Opinions were taken, and the tribunal decided that Joan should hear the articles read this time. Maybe that was on account of Lohier’s remark upon that head; or maybe it was hoped that the reading would kill the prisoner with fatigue⁠—for, as it turned out, this reading occupied several days. It was also decided that Joan should be required to answer squarely to every article, and that if she refused she should be considered <em>convicted</em>. You see, Cauchon was managing to narrow her chances more and more all the time; he was drawing the toils closer and closer.</p>
			<p>Joan was brought in, and the Bishop of Beauvais opened with a speech to her which ought to have made even himself blush, so laden it was with hypocrisy and lies. He said that this court was composed of holy and pious churchmen whose hearts were full of benevolence and compassion toward her, and that they had no wish to hurt her body, but only a desire to instruct her and lead her into the way of truth and salvation.</p>
			<p>Why, this man was born a devil; now think of his describing himself and those hardened slaves of his in such language as that.</p>
			<p>And yet, worse was to come. For now having in mind another of Lovier’s hints, he had the cold effrontery to make to Joan a proposition which, I think, will surprise you when you hear it. He said that this court, recognizing her untaught estate and her inability to deal with the complex and difficult matters which were about to be considered, had determined, out of their pity and their mercifulness, to allow her to choose one or more persons <em>out of their own number</em> to help her with counsel and advice!</p>
			<p>Think of that⁠—a court made up of Loyseleur and his breed of reptiles. It was granting leave to a lamb to ask help of a wolf. Joan looked up to see if he was serious, and perceiving that he was at least pretending to be, she declined, of course.</p>
			<p>The Bishop was not expecting any other reply. He had made a show of fairness and could have it entered on the minutes, therefore he was satisfied.</p>
			<p>Then he commanded Joan to answer straitly to every accusation; and threatened to cut her off from the Church if she failed to do that or delayed her answers beyond a given length of time. Yes, he was narrowing her chances down, step by step.</p>
			<p>Thomas de Courcelles began the reading of that interminable document, article by article. Joan answered to each article in its turn; sometimes merely denying its truth, sometimes by saying her answer would be found in the records of the previous trials.</p>
			<p>What a strange document that was, and what an exhibition and exposure of the heart of man, the one creature authorized to boast that he is made in the image of God. To know Joan of Arc was to know one who was wholly noble, pure, truthful, brave, compassionate, generous, pious, unselfish, modest, blameless as the very flowers in the fields⁠—a nature fine and beautiful, a character supremely great. To know her from that document would be to know her as the exact reverse of all that. Nothing that she <em>was</em> appears in it, everything that she was <em>not</em> appears there in detail.</p>
			<p>Consider some of the things it charges against her, and remember who it is it is speaking of. It calls her a sorceress, a false prophet, an invoker and companion of evil spirits, a dealer in magic, a person ignorant of the Catholic faith, a schismatic; she is sacrilegious, an idolater, an apostate, a blasphemer of God and His saints, scandalous, seditious, a disturber of the peace; she incites men to war, and to the spilling of human blood; she discards the decencies and proprieties of her sex, irreverently assuming the dress of a man and the vocation of a soldier; she beguiles both princes and people; she usurps divine honors, and has caused herself to be adored and venerated, offering her hands and her vestments to be kissed.</p>
			<p>There it is⁠—every fact of her life distorted, perverted, reversed. As a child she had loved the fairies, she had spoken a pitying word for them when they were banished from their home, she had played under their tree and around their fountain⁠—hence she was a comrade of evil spirits. She had lifted France out of the mud and moved her to strike for freedom, and led her to victory after victory⁠—hence she was a disturber of the peace⁠—as indeed she was, and a provoker of war⁠—as indeed she was again! and France will be proud of it and grateful for it for many a century to come. And she had been adored⁠—as if she could help that, poor thing, or was in any way to blame for it. The cowed veteran and the wavering recruit had drunk the spirit of war from her eyes and touched her sword with theirs and moved forward invincible⁠—hence she was a sorceress.</p>
			<p>And so the document went on, detail by detail, turning these waters of life to poison, this gold to dross, these proofs of a noble and beautiful life to evidences of a foul and odious one.</p>
			<p>Of course, the sixty-six articles were just a rehash of the things which had come up in the course of the previous trials, so I will touch upon this new trial but lightly. In fact, Joan went but little into detail herself, usually merely saying, “That is not true⁠—<i xml:lang="fr">passez outré</i>”; or, “I have answered that before⁠—let the clerk read it in his record,” or saying some other brief thing.</p>
			<p>She refused to have her mission examined and tried by the earthly Church. The refusal was taken note of.</p>
			<p>She denied the accusation of idolatry and that she had sought men’s homage. She said:</p>
			<p>“If any kissed my hands and my vestments it was not by my desire, and I did what I could to prevent it.”</p>
			<p>She had the pluck to say to that deadly tribunal that she did not know the fairies to be evil beings. She knew it was a perilous thing to say, but it was not in her nature to speak anything but the truth when she spoke at all. Danger had no weight with her in such things. Note was taken of her remark.</p>
			<p>She refused, as always before, when asked if she would put off the male attire if she were given permission to commune. And she added this:</p>
			<p>“When one receives the sacrament, the manner of his dress is a small thing and of no value in the eyes of Our Lord.”</p>
			<p>She was charged with being so stubborn in clinging to her male dress that she would not lay it off even to get the blessed privilege of hearing Mass. She spoke out with spirit and said:</p>
			<p>“I would rather die than be untrue to my oath to God.”</p>
			<p>She was reproached with doing man’s work in the wars and thus deserting the industries proper to her sex. She answered, with some little touch of soldierly disdain:</p>
			<p>“As to the matter of women’s work, there’s plenty to do it.”</p>
			<p>It was always a comfort to me to see the soldier spirit crop up in her. While that remained in her she would be Joan of Arc, and able to look trouble and fate in the face.</p>
			<p>“It appears that this mission of yours which you claim you had from God, was to make war and pour out human blood.”</p>
			<p>Joan replied quite simply, contenting herself with explaining that war was not her first move, but her second:</p>
			<p>“To begin with, I demanded that peace should be made. If it was refused, then I would fight.”</p>
			<p>The judge mixed the Burgundians and English together in speaking of the enemy which Joan had come to make war upon. But she showed that she made a distinction between them by act and word, the Burgundians being Frenchmen and therefore entitled to less brusque treatment than the English. She said:</p>
			<p>“As to the Duke of Burgundy, I required of him, both by letters and by his ambassadors, that he make peace with the King. As to the English, the only peace for them was that they leave the country and go home.”</p>
			<p>Then she said that even with the English she had shown a pacific disposition, since she had warned them away by proclamation before attacking them.</p>
			<p>“If they had listened to me,” said she, “they would have done wisely.” At this point she uttered her prophecy again, saying with emphasis, “Before seven years they will see it themselves.”</p>
			<p>Then they presently began to pester her again about her male costume, and tried to persuade her to voluntarily promise to discard it. I was never deep, so I think it no wonder that I was puzzled by their persistency in what seemed a thing of no consequence, and could not make out what their reason could be. But we all know now. We all know now that it was another of their treacherous projects. Yes, if they could but succeed in getting her to formally discard it they could play a game upon her which would quickly destroy her. So they kept at their evil work until at last she broke out and said:</p>
			<p>“Peace! Without the permission of God I will not lay it off though you cut off my head!”</p>
			<p>At one point she corrected the procès verbal, saying:</p>
			<p>“It makes me say that everything which I have done was done by the counsel of Our Lord. I did not say that, I said ‘all which I have <em>well</em> done.’ ”</p>
			<p>Doubt was cast upon the authenticity of her mission because of the ignorance and simplicity of the messenger chosen. Joan smiled at that. She could have reminded these people that Our Lord, who is no respecter of persons, had chosen the lowly for his high purposes even oftener than he had chosen bishops and cardinals; but she phrased her rebuke in simpler terms:</p>
			<p>“It is the prerogative of Our Lord to choose His instruments where He will.”</p>
			<p>She was asked what form of prayer she used in invoking counsel from on high. She said the form was brief and simple; then she lifted her pallid face and repeated it, clasping her chained hands:</p>
			<p>“Most dear God, in honor of your holy passion I beseech you, if you love me, that you will reveal to me what I am to answer to these churchmen. As concerns my dress, I know by what command I have put it on, but I know not in what manner I am to lay it off. I pray you tell me what to do.”</p>
			<p>She was charged with having dared, against the precepts of God and His saints, to assume empire over men and make herself Commander-in-Chief. That touched the soldier in her. She had a deep reverence for priests, but the soldier in her had but small reverence for a priest’s opinions about war; so, in her answer to this charge she did not condescend to go into any explanations or excuses, but delivered herself with bland indifference and military brevity.</p>
			<p>“If I was Commander-in-Chief, it was to thrash the English!”</p>
			<p>Death was staring her in the face here all the time, but no matter; she dearly loved to make these English-hearted Frenchmen squirm, and whenever they gave her an opening she was prompt to jab her sting into it. She got great refreshment out of these little episodes. Her days were a desert; these were the oases in it.</p>
			<p>Her being in the wars with men was charged against her as an indelicacy. She said:</p>
			<p>“I had a woman with me when I could⁠—in towns and lodgings. In the field I always slept in my armor.”</p>
			<p>That she and her family had been ennobled by the King was charged against her as evidence that the source of her deeds were sordid self-seeking. She answered that she had not asked this grace of the King; it was his own act.</p>
			<p>This third trial was ended at last. And once again there was no definite result.</p>
			<p>Possibly a fourth trial might succeed in defeating this apparently unconquerable girl. So the malignant Bishop set himself to work to plan it.</p>
			<p>He appointed a commission to reduce the substance of the sixty-six articles to twelve compact lies, as a basis for the new attempt. This was done. It took several days.</p>
			<p>Meantime Cauchon went to Joan’s cell one day, with Manchon and two of the judges, Isambard de la Pierre and Martin Ladvenue, to see if he could not manage somehow to beguile Joan into submitting her mission to the examination and decision of the church militant⁠—that is to say, to that part of the church militant which was represented by himself and his creatures.</p>
			<p>Joan once more positively refused. Isambard de la Pierre had a heart in his body, and he so pitied this persecuted poor girl that he ventured to do a very daring thing; for he asked her if she would be willing to have her case go before the Council of Basel, and said it contained as many priests of her party as of the English party.</p>
			<p>Joan cried out that she would gladly go before so fairly constructed a tribunal as that; but before Isambard could say another word Cauchon turned savagely upon him and exclaimed:</p>
			<p>“Shut up, in the devil’s name!”</p>
			<p>Then Manchon ventured to do a brave thing, too, though he did it in great fear for his life. He asked Cauchon if he should enter Joan’s submission to the Council of Basel upon the minutes.</p>
			<p>“No! It is not necessary.”</p>
			<p>“Ah,” said poor Joan, reproachfully, “you set down everything that is against me, but you will not set down what is for me.”</p>
			<p>It was piteous. It would have touched the heart of a brute. But Cauchon was more than that.</p>
